# Project Name: Personalized Front-end Project with React JS
## Description
Welcome to the personalized front-end project developed using React JS. This project is designed to reflect individual personalities through an engaging and user-friendly interface. The front-end consists of two main pages, each crafted to showcase different aspects of one's identity.

### Home Page
The home page serves as the entry point to the site. It features a navigation bar created from a owner photo, with each part of their face representing one of their hobbies. At the top of the page, a pyramid allows users to choose between three languages: Arabic, French, and English. Below the navigation bar, the user's name is highlighted along with a brief description that captures their essence.

To enhance the user experience, a music playback button is placed in the bottom left corner. Clicking this button triggers a soothing yoga music track, creating a calming atmosphere.

### Page Selector
The "Page Selector" is the main page of the site, divided into three sections:

Left Side: A hamburger menu for easy navigation.
Center: Dynamic content that changes with each selection in the navigation bar.
Right Side: Another similarly sized component that optimizes the user experience and can transform into a navigation bar when needed.
The "Page Selector" component comprises multiple sub-pages, providing an organized and easily navigable structure. A notable feature of the site is the ability to switch between Arabic, French, and English at any time using the pyramid located in the top left corner.
